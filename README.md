Headers tree:

lib/platform/api_bsd.h  -  header file for BSD sockets     : includes section only;
lib/platform/api_nt.h   -  header file for Winsock sockets : includes section only;
	lib/platform/connect.h  -  detect platfrom and then includes related header; defines cross platform routine macros; includes routine header;
			lib/routine.h  -  cross platform routine helper functions; body of header are divided by supported platforms;
			lib/routine.c  -  includes connect.h;
			lib/socket/tcp.h  -  TCP-related socket routine; cross platform; includes connect header;

Direct header tree (legacy):

connect app:
  include platform/connect.h  <---  (api_bsd || api_nt) && routine
  include socket/tcp.h        <---  platform/connect.h

connect app (easy way):
connect app:
  include (lib)/connect.h  <---  platform/connect.h socket/tcp.h ...
